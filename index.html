      <h2>Characterization</h2>
      <p>I’ve reached my finish line</p>
        <p>Although they say “You're doing fine”</p>
        <p>why me, Why me, WHY ME!!!</p>
        <p>My life’s debris, why can’t they see</p>
        <p>Hurts to think, hurts to dine</p>
        <br>
        <p>That is when I would whine</p>
        <p>The future is going to shine</p>
        <p>You’ll see, you’ll see, you’ll see</p>
        <p>How much better living can be</p>
        <p>I’ll be doing just fine</p>
        <br>
        <p>My leg is frankenstein</p>
        <p>But I’m fine above my waistline</p>
        <p>Badly, badly, badly</p>
        <p>I want to run and become me</p>
        <p>But I can’t cross this line</p>
        <br>
        <p>There is so much sunshine</p>
        <p>But in my world, I won’t align</p>
        <p>Messy, messy, messy</p>
        <p>Is me if I walk out blindly</p>
        <p>Which is why I still whine</p>
        <br>
        <p>But healing is a sign</p>
        <p>That my coming future is all mine</p>
        <p>Be free, be free, be free</p>
        <p>Of any cages there may be</p>
        <p>Make a new starting line</p>

      <h1>My Vessel</h1>
      <h2>Conflict</h2>
      <p>My ship has crashed along the rocky shore</p>
      <p>The anchor of 20 pounds has sunk in</p>
      <p>The engine of my vessel has been tore</p>
      <p>The chances of sailing again are thin</p>
      <br>
      <p>There is no way that I can fix this ship</p>
      <p>Soon the lost parts are going to go adrift</p>
      <p>Or maybe I just need to get a grip</p>
      <p>There is a way that my spirits will lift</p>
      <br>
      <p>The impure parts are the ones I will slay</p>
      <p>One step at a time I will make it new</p>
      <p>My brand new ship will sail away today</p>
      <p>Now I know where the ship is going to</p>
      <br>
      <p>Uncharted waters with sights to behold</p>
      <p>With old dents a new current will unfold</p>

      <h1>Shattered Pot</h1>
      <h2>Theme</h2>
      <p>"Shhh, my mother whispers, "It'll be okay"</p>
      <p>But this lie will not fix this accident</p>
      <p>Thousands of pieces lay on the parquet</p>
      <p>I shake my head, angry that my pot's bent</p>
      <br>
      <p>Too many pieces, how will I fix it</p>
      <p>Maybe I can repair it one by one</p>
      <p>I'm still in a complete funk, but have grit</p>
      <p>Since my hopeless pot is now getting done</p>
      <br>
      <p>With help from friends, the pot is made anew</p>
      <p>Although it will never be better than</p>
      <p>the original pot that was brand new</p>
      <p>I know not what I can't, but what I can</p>
